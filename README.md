a super simple responsive landing page.

## Using this code

Obviously, you'll want to rebrand all the ld+json data, your links, etc.

**Please remove the track code from the bottom of the page!**

Someone used my code for a porn site once.
It took me a while to figure out why I was suddenly getting all this traffic from Turkey and Russia -
not to mention to such explicit paths.

So yeah. Respect your visitors and don't send their data to me.

### Features

1. super simple html5 layout
2. flexbox is real darn nifty
3. font awesome
4. ld+json in the header for mo' betta' search engine-ing
5. in-page css to minimize requests
